## Hold on, what is all this code about?

</br>

We have a couple of things going on here.

Let's take a look at the code in the `pipeline.go` file.

## The pipeline stage

The commands are essentially mapped to what becomes a Dockerfile.

This is all orchestrated by Dagger and we will never see the Dockerfile as such, but under the hood that is more or less what is happening.

</br>

Andâ€”it is the same principle when writing the Dagger workflow code in Python or TypeScript.

## When in doubt...

...use the SDK reference.

Since we are using the Dagger **Go** SDK in these examples, the [Dagger Go SDK reference](https://pkg.go.dev/dagger.io/dagger) is a good place to start if you want to know more about the SDK and the commands that are available.

Okay, let's move on to running the pipeline locally.
