# Object Oriented Programming in Go

Go is a **post-OOP language**.

Go does *not* have classes, but it has types and methods.

Go does *not* have constructors, but it has `init()` functions.

Go does *not* have inheritance, but it has composition.

Go achieves polymorphism with the help of interfaces and composition.

Go supports encapsulation.

Go supports abstraction with the help of interfaces and structs. Packages in Go are also a form of abstraction.
