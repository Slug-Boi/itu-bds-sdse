# Composition

Composition implements a **"has-a"** relationship. It allows a class to contain an object of another class.

## Advantages

- **Flexibility:** </br></br>Composition and interfaces allow for decoupled designs. You can change the components of a struct or the implementation of an interface without affecting other parts of your program.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

- **Simplicity:** </br></br>Avoiding classical inheritance can lead to simpler, more straightforward code. It encourages thinking in terms of what objects do (behaviors) rather than what they are in an inheritance hierarchy.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

- **Maintainability:** </br></br>Code that uses interfaces and composition is often easier to maintain and extend, as changes tend to be more localized.
