## Exercise: Singly Linked List

### Instructions

Create a singly linked list in Go.

The linked list should have the following methods:

* `InsertLast` - inserts a new node at the end of the list.
* `DeleteLast` - deletes the last node from the list.
* `Display` - prints the list from beginning to end.

The linked list should accept a data of type `string`, e.g. `InsertLast(data string)`.

When displaying the list, print the data of each node—e.g. output might look like this:

</br>

```plaintext
"Hello" -> "My" -> "World" -> "!"
```

</br>

#### Extra — Implement one or more of the following methods

* `InsertFirst` - inserts a new node at the beginning of the list.
* `DeleteFirst` - deletes the first node from the list.
* `InsertAt` - inserts a new node at a given position.
* `DeleteAt` - deletes a node at a given position.
* `Reverse` - reverses the list.
