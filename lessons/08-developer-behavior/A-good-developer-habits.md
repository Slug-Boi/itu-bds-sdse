## Always start with the foundation

This means before we actually start building "the thing", we need to have setup a repeatable way to build/run/deploy "the thing".

This allows us to move fast and iterate quickly.

It is *always* a pain to setup the foundation after we have started building "the thing". The code will tend to encircle manual, undocumented processes.

## Broken things are fixed immediately

**Never leave the pipeline broken**. Fix it immediately. Priority over everything else, especially if we are in a team.

## Keep documentation next to the code

Simple things like a concise `README.md` file in the root of the repository with simple and clear instructions can alter the perception of the project and boost its adoption.

## Good design is invisible

Keep things simple. If it is hard to understand, it is hard to maintain.
