## Github in practice

*(Live session)*

</br>

- GitHub introduction, new repository
- Branching
- Pull requests
- Code reviews
- Continuous integration
- Starting new, build the pipeline foundation first
- CODEOWNERS
- Workflows and actions
- (Releases, maybe)

</br>

> **Note:** We will talk about Github workflows and Dagger workflows. Both are pipelines, but they are not the same thing.
