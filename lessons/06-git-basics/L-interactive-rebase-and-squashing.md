## Interactive rebasing and squashing

Sometimes we want to ***squash*** multiple commits into one. 

Maybe we did a lot of small commits with poor messages while working on a feature. Maybe we want to push a single commit containing all the changes for the featureâ€”making it easy to revert later on, if needed.

In practice this is done with interactive rebasing.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

Essentially squashing takes this.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

And turns it into this.

</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

Interactive rebasing allows squashing commits but also allows us to edit commit messages, reorder commits, and even remove commits.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

### Exercise: Squashing commits - set the stage

We need to set the stage first by creating some commits.

> * Navigate to the `remote-git` repository.
> * Checkout the `feature` branch.
> * Append **3 changes** to the `README.md` file and commit each change with a unique message.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

### Solution: Squashing commits - set the stage

Navigate to the `remote-git` repository.

```bash
git checkout feature
echo "Change 1" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Change 1"
echo "Change 2" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Change 2"
echo "Change 3" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Change 3"
```

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

## Interactive rebase steps

To begin, we need to provide a point in time to rebase with. The simplest way to do this is typically with `HEAD~n`, where `n` is the number of commits back we want to go. This format is also called a ***commit-ish***.

So, `HEAD~1` means one commit back from `HEAD`.

</br>
</br>

The command for interactive rebase is:

```bash
git rebase -i <commit-ish>
```

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

### Exercise: Squashing commits - interactive rebase

Now we will squash the commits.

We want all the 3 latest changes to be a single commit and update the commit message.

> * Start an interactive rebase with the last 3 commits.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

### Solution: Squashing commits - interactive rebase

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

</br>

**Output:**

```plaintext
pick a4ebcc2 Change 1
pick 04b43c8 Change 2
pick 8406816 Change 3

# Rebase 7142285..8406816 onto 7142285 (3 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup [-C | -c] <commit> = like "squash" but keep only the previous
#                    commit's log message, unless -C is used, in which case
#                    keep only this commit's message; -c is same as -C but
#                    opens the editor
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
#         create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
#         message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
#         specified); use -c <commit> to reword the commit message
# u, update-ref <ref> = track a placeholder for the <ref> to be updated
#                       to this position in the new commits. The <ref> is
#                       updated at the end of the rebase
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
```

</br>

To squash the commits, we need to change the `pick` command to `squash` or `s` for the commits we want to squash.

</br>

```plaintext
pick a4ebcc2 Change 1
s 04b43c8 Change 2
s 8406816 Change 3
```

And we save with `:wq` and `Enter`.

</br>
</br>

This brings up the editor to edit the commit message.

**Output:**

```plaintext
# This is a combination of 3 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

Change 1

# This is the commit message #2:

Change 2

# This is the commit message #3:

Change 3

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Wed Sep 25 00:24:11 2024 +0200
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto 7142285
# Last commands done (3 commands done):
#    squash 04b43c8 Change 2
#    squash 8406816 Change 3
# No commands remaining.
# You are currently rebasing branch 'main' on '7142285'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   README.md
#
~
~
~
```

</br>
</br>

We edit the commit message to something like `Feature X`.

**Output:**

```plaintext
# This is a combination of 3 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

Feature X

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Wed Sep 25 00:24:11 2024 +0200
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto 7142285
# Last commands done (3 commands done):
#    squash 04b43c8 Change 2
#    squash 8406816 Change 3
# No commands remaining.
# You are currently rebasing branch 'main' on '7142285'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   README.md
#
~
~
~
```

And again we save with `:wq` and `Enter`.

</br>

**Output:**

```plaintext
[detached HEAD e3f045e] Feature X
 Date: Wed Sep 25 00:24:11 2024 +0200
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/main.
```

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

Check the log to see the changes.

```bash
git log --oneline --graph
```

</br>

We will see that the 3 commits have been squashed into one with the message `Feature X`.

**Output:**

```plaintext
* e3f045e (HEAD -> main) Feature X
```

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

When we push to the remote respository, and in some cases you may need to do `git push --force` to overwrite the remote branch.

Know that it exists. Use `--force` with caution.
