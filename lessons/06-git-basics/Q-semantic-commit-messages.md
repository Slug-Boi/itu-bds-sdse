## Semantic commit messages

People who work on code and version control it in a repository (e.g. git), often do not think about the importance of writing good commit messages. Especially as the amount of contributors increaseâ€”both concurrently and over time as people come and go.

## It is pretty simple, really

We prefix the commit message with a type, and then a description.

```plaintext
feat:     # work related to a feature
docs:     # changes to documentation
fix:      # bug fix
style:    # formatting
refactor: # refactoring and reducing technical debt
test:     # changes related to tests
chore:    # changes that are minor, like updating dependencies
ci:       # changes to pipelines, build systems, etc.
```

</br>

A prefix can also be scoped ( `feat(scope): description` ), and the description can be multiline.

And breaking changes can be highlighted with a `!` after the type/scope, e.g. `feat!: description`.

Semantic commit messages is a pattern that can also be applied at the user story level in many backlogs (Scrum/Kanban).
