# Stuff to install

We will be using VSCode as our editor, and we will be using the terminal to run our code.

If you are using Windows, using WSL2 is recommended. You can install it by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Ubuntu is recommended as the Linux distribution.

1. Install Go from [here](https://golang.org/dl/) or if you are using Homebrew, run `brew install go`.

2. Install the following [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go) in VSCode:

This will install several tool integrations but more importantly the Go LSP.
