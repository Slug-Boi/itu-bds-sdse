## Goroutines

* **goroutines** are lightweight threads.
* A **goroutine** is created by invoking any function with a `go` prefix.
* `go functionName()`

* **goroutines** can communicate with each other using *channels*, which is a special type of variable.
* A **channel** can contain a *value* of *any kind*.
* A **goroutine** can send a value to a **channel** and another **goroutine** can receive it.
* Channels can be *buffered* or *unbuffered*.
