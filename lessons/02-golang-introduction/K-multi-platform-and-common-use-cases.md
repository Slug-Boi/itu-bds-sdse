# Multi-platform

- Can generate executable binary files for different platforms and operating systems
- Compiles to WebAssembly (WASM)
- Transpiles to JavaScript (GopherJS)

[Compatibility](https://gist.github.com/asukakenji/f15ba7e588ac42795f421b48b8aede63) with different platforms (unofficially).

# Can Go be used for Machine Learning?

Yes, but it is not the best choice. Python is the most popular language for Machine Learning.

Several reasons for this, but the main one is the number of libraries and frameworks available for Python and lack of [basic support in Go for e.g. CUDA and math/statistics libraries](https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2023/06/22/does-machine-learning-in-go-have-a-future/).
