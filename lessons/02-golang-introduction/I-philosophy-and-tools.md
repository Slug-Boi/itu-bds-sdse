# Philosophy

- Simplicity
- Cross-platform support
- Existence of network requests and concurrency execution
- Library-free experience; the standard library is enough for strings, network, file management, testing
- Backwards compatibility
- Command Line Interface is powerful

<!-- 
Everything is under the 3 goals (ease of use, efficient execution, and efficient compilation)
-->
