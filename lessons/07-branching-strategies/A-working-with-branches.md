## Working with branches

## Some reasons to use branches

- **Isolation**: Branches allow you to work on a feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase.
- **Collaboration**: Branches allow multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously.
- **Testing**: Branches allow you to test new features or bug fixes before merging them into the main codebase.
- **Experimentation**: Branches allow you to experiment with new features or ideas without affecting the main codebase.
- **Backup**: Branches allow you to create a backup of your work in case something goes wrong.
- **Code review**: Branches allow you to create a pull request for code review before merging it into the main codebase.
- **Release management**: Branches allow you to manage releases by creating release branches for each release.

That said, there are several branching strategies available in the industry. Some are:

- **Feature branching**: Create a branch for each feature or bug fix.
- **Release branching**: Create a branch for each release.
- **Gitflow**: A branching model that defines a strict branching strategy.
- **Trunk-based development**: A branching model where all developers work on a single branch.

### Branching falls into two categories:

- **Long-lived branches**: Branches that exist for a long time, such as `main`.
- **Short-lived branches**: Branches that are created for a specific feature or bug fix and are deleted after merging.

</br>

As a contributor to a codebase, you use branches to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments. You create a new branch for each task and work on it until it is *ready* to be merged into the main codebase.

**Ready** (usually, but varies with team contracts) means that the code is *tested*, *reviewed*, and *approved by the team*. Once the code is ready, you **merge** the branch into the main codebase and **delete the branch**.

When you become part of a cross-functional team working with software, it is important to master versioning your code and litterally not break the shared codebase—"the source of truth"—for other team members. Branches play a crucial role here and is a great place to experiment.

But do not fall in the trap of having long-lived branches. **You** will end up with the responsibility of merging and resolving conflicts. This is not a fun task.
