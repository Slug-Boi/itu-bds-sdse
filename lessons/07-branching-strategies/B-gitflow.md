## Gitflow

Gitflow is a branching model that helps teams manage their codebase by defining a strict branching strategy. It was created by Vincent Driessen and is widely used in the software industry.

> **Only** use Gitflow if you are working on a **large project** with **numerous developers** and/or **multiple development teams**. For small projects, Gitflow **IS** overkill and will cause slowdown due to complexity. Large here means projects such as the Youtube mobile app, or projects with 100+ developers across multiple teams where releases are not happening on a daily basis (typically).

> **Advice:** Be pragmatic. And be cautious if you see Gitflow being used in a small project.

### Gitflow defines two primary branches:

- `main`: The main branch that contains the production-ready code.
- `develop`: The main branch that contains the latest development code.

</br>

### Additionally, it defines three types of supporting branches:

- `feature`: Branches used to develop new features.
- `release`: Branches used to prepare a new release.
- `hotfix`: Branches used to fix bugs in the production code.

## Feature branches

Feature branches are used to develop new features or bug fixes. They are created from the `develop` branch and merged back into the `develop` branch when the feature is complete.

## Release branches

Release branches are used to prepare a new release. They are created from the `develop` branch and merged back into the `develop` and `main` branches when the release is complete.

## Hotfix branches

Feature branches are used to develop new features or bug fixes. They are created from the `develop` branch and merged back into the `develop` branch when the feature is complete.

## So.. what is challenging in this from a developer perspective?

</br>
</br>

</br>
</br>
</br>

- **Complexity**: Gitflow is complex and can be difficult to understand for new developers.
- **Overhead**: Gitflow introduces overhead in terms of managing multiple branches.
- **Slowdown**: Gitflow can slow down the development process due to the complexity of managing multiple branches.
- **Merge conflicts**: Gitflow can lead to more merge conflicts due to the number of branches that need to be merged.
- **Overkill**: Gitflow is overkill for small projects with a small team of developers.
- **Release management**: Gitflow can be cumbersome for managing releases.

There are simpler alternativesâ€”One is called **trunk-based development**.
